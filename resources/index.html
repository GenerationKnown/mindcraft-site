              <p><strong>Minecraft</strong> is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things.</p>     
              <p>It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. Itâ€™s pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea. </p>

          <p>Before getting into the nitty griddy of developer jargon, let's just cover what you need to know. First of all, we are using minecraft, a game developed by <strong>Mojang</strong>. It's an open world that is extremely easy to modify and create with. Our modding is supported by <strong>bukkit</strong>, a wrapper for the minecraft server. It allows us to add our mods, which are <strong>Denizens</strong>, <strong>World Edit</strong>, and <strong>World Guard</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Denizens</strong> is a mod that allows moderators of the server to add NPCs and scripts to the world. This mod is used to make sentries and quizzers, the actual educational parts of learning landscape. </p>
          <p><strong>World Edit</strong> is a mod that allows developers to edit the world using in game code lines typed into chat. You can learn more about <strong>World Edit</strong> below.</p>
          <p><strong>World guard</strong> is a mod that can set areas and permissions. These permissions include block permissions, destruction permissions, and other permissions in the area.</p>
          <p>Learning landscape combines many component technologies.</p>

        <p> Learning Landscape is a server in <a href="https://minecraft.net">MineCraft</a> dedicated to educational gameplay. There are locational nodes that each indicate a particular subject or topic. Each of these nodes has sentries, or non-playable characters (NPCs) that are capable of asking questions.</p>
        <p>Although there are limited nodes, we have created tutorials so that teachers from all over the world may add their own material and questions. It is our hope that Learning Landscape will become a visual, playable and engaging knowledge map.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>This is an example of what the final file will look like:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/aztec8/5514466.js"></script>        
            <p>How to format a text file so it can be read by the Terrain Generator:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Step 1: Find the subject you want to map on Khan Academy.</li>
              <li>Step 2: Get the URL of that subject. It will look something like this: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/e/addition_2</li>
              <li>Step 3: Use that URL to create the formatted node like so:</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The file format has 5 lines per subject.</p>

              <dt>DisplayName:</dt>
              <dd>This is the title of the subject in proper English. The player sees this. If you go to the URL, this is the visible title of the page. (In this case: "2-digit addition")</dd>
              <!-- filename -->
              <dt>Filename:</dt>
              <dd>This is the title of the subject in a language the computer can read better. Computers don't like spaces, they like underscores. You can find your filename at the end of the URL. (In this case: "addition_2")</dd>
              <!-- url -->
              <dt>URL:</dt>

              <dd> The pre-requisite subjects that the user must pass to access this subject. Each pre-requisite subject is referenced by FileName, not DisplayName. If there are no pre-reqs, write N/A instead. (In this case: "number_line", "addition_1", and "representing_numbers")</dd>
